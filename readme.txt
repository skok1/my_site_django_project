This website is my personal project, crafted using the Django framework.
I've employed PostgreSQL for database management, and Python as the
primary programming language. The design incorporates standard principles
of CSS and HTML. I'd like to mention that this site functions as a blog,
where you can peruse and create posts, leave comments, and even bookmark
intriguing content for later reading.

PS:I sent my database. DATABASE name is "dataase.sql"
